If you were to be the president of Board of Cricket Control in India (BCCI), what would you do to preserve and promote the future on cricket in India? Keep in mind that the future of cricket will be bright only if the sport continues to attract more and more talented players and enjoys support amongst the fans.

I believe that to ensure a bright future of cricket in India, we need to have more talened people on the ground. To make that possible, I would try to improve the condition of cricket at state and lower levels. I will do the following.

Get more money in this sector, by getting in more advertisement, more investors.
Introduce a tournament where our National teams get to play in foriegn grounds with foriegn teams.

Apart from this, I would also try to get the Indian pitches to be helpful for fast bowlers, thus improving the condition of Indian fast bowlers. Another thing that I would like to initiate is a better selection procedure, which is based purely on statistics, thus a player not performing will have to leave the team.
