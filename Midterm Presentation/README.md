The file lists and oauth-tokens need to be stored as the number of api calls in a day is limited (around 1000). To do a simple upload/download/browse, around 3-5 api calls are required, which highly limits the number of users which can use the app per-day.

The size of files for upload/download is limited (around 150MB).
